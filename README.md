# Sirius - A Secure Multi-cloud Network Virtualization version 0.2

Sirius is a resilient multi-cloud network virtualization platform, spanning multiple heterogeneous  Cloud Service  Providers  (CSPs), that leverages on software-defined networking techniques. This network virtualization solution will enable the creation of virtual networks that span multiple heterogeneous clouds in a transparent way to the SIRIUS users.

Each module (Orchestrator and the Hypervisor) has a readme with detailed instructions for running Sirius. They are inside the folders orchestrator and hypervisor respectively.

As the simulation's data are considerably large in size, these are published in the url: https://cloud.lasige.di.fc.ul.pt/index.php/s/5XTBzwck5zDnxme
